## Base assumptions (seasonal method)

- Fixed calendar window each year: Sep Corn (CBOT), sell near **Jul 18**, exit near **Jul 25**.
- Date snapping: first exchange trading day **on or after** the target dates.
- Contract selection: the **specific September contract for that year** (e.g., ZCU13), not a back-adjusted continuous.
- Pricing: official **settlements** for entry/exit; intra-window **daily high/low** for best/worst equity.
- P&L units: cents/bu; 1.00¢ = **$50** per contract (5,000 bu). Tick 0.25¢.
- No optimization of dates; window fixed ex-ante across all years.
- Equal weighting across years; no winsorization or reweighting.
- Commissions/slippage excluded unless specified.
- Exchange calendar respected (weekends/holidays).
- Missing or illegible cells excluded from stats until resolved.
- Stats section aggregates **per-year realized results**; no seasonal index smoothing or within-year averaging.
