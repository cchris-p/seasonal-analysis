    "Implements an **MRCI-style seasonal analysis** for **OANDA spot forex data** to identify recurring profitable calendar windows (buy or sell periods) for a given currency pair. It adapts MRCI’s futures-based process to continuous, non-expiring FX data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Data Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `get_forex_data_by_pair` should return a pandas DataFrame indexed by date, with columns like `Open, High, Low, Close`.\n",
    "* The analysis runs on the `Close` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `_ensure_dt_index()` ensures the DataFrame index is a `DatetimeIndex`.\n",
    "* `_available_years()` lists which years are covered.\n",
    "* `_snap_to_trading_day()` aligns any target date to the next or previous actual trading day in your data (e.g., skip weekends).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Yearly Normalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `compute_year_range_normalized_index()` scales each day’s price within its own year to a 0–100 range:\n",
    "\n",
    "  [\n",
    "  r_t = 100 \\times \\frac{P_t - P_{min,y}}{P_{max,y} - P_{min,y}}\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "\n",
    "  This removes long-term drift and makes each year’s pattern comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Seasonal Pattern Curve**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `build_seasonal_pattern_curve()` averages these 0–100 normalized values by **calendar month-day (MM-DD)** across the last *N* years (default 15).\n",
    "* The result is the **seasonal index curve**, showing the average relative price position throughout the year.\n",
    "* Optional smoothing removes noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Calendar Window Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `generate_calendar_grid()` builds all possible entry/exit pairs within chosen months and day ranges (e.g., entry between 5th–25th, exit between 10th–31st).\n",
    "* Each pair defines a possible trading window (e.g., enter Feb 10 → exit Mar 15).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Year-by-Year Backtest**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `_compute_window_pnl_for_year()` computes, for each window and each year:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * entry/exit dates (snapped to valid days),\n",
    "  * profit in **pips** (long or short),\n",
    "  * best run-up and worst drawdown during the trade (on closing prices).\n",
    "* `_pip_factor_for_symbol()` sets pip conversion (100 for JPY pairs, 10 000 otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Scoring and Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `score_windows_on_spot()` aggregates results:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * win rate (fraction of profitable years),\n",
    "  * average and median profit,\n",
    "  * worst loss, drawdown, and run-up.\n",
    "* Windows must pass reliability filters:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ≥ 80 % win rate,\n",
    "  * ≥ 10 years of data,\n",
    "  * positive average profit.\n",
    "* Direction can be fixed (`long`/`short`) or **auto-selected**: the code looks at the seasonal curve slope between entry and exit and chooses the side that follows the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Ranking and Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Windows are ranked by composite score = (win rate × average profit).\n",
    "* `run_spot_seasonal_analysis()` orchestrates everything and returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `seasonal_curve` – the 0–100 pattern for the last N years.\n",
    "  * `top_windows` – list of best seasonal trade windows with stats.\n",
    "  * `per_year_results` – detailed yearly entry/exit/P&L data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. **Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **seasonal curve** shows typical strength/weakness periods.\n",
    "* The **best windows** identify high-reliability date ranges to buy or sell the pair each year.\n",
    "* The results are settlement-based (daily closes), aligned with MRCI’s methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "eurusd_df = load_your_data(\"EURUSD\")  # your DataFrame of OHLC\n",
    "result = run_spot_seasonal_analysis(\"EURUSD\", df=eurusd_df)\n",
    "\n",
    "for w in result[\"top_windows\"][:5]:\n",
    "    print(w)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll get calendar date windows like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Entry 02-15 → Exit 03-10, Win Rate = 86 %, Avg Profit = +55 pips\n",
    "Entry 07-05 → Exit 07-25, Win Rate = 81 %, Avg Profit = +42 pips\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this code **discovers statistically consistent seasonal trade windows** for any OANDA forex pair, replicating the **MRCI 15-year seasonal pattern and reliability test** without using futures data.\n"
